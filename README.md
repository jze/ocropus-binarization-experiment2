# ocropus-binarization-experiment2

## Prerequisites

Since this is an OCRopus experiment you will of cause need a working installation of OCRopus https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy  

Most of the binarization are done using the command line interface of ScanTailor http://scantailor.org/  On Debian and Ubuntu ScanTailor can be installed from the package archive with

	sudo apt-get install scantailor

For the experiment I have used version 0.9.11.1 of ScanTailor.

## The Experiment

During the experiment different binarization will be created. You can run the entire experiment with 

	./run.sh
